# Object and Vehicle Detection

## Project Description

This project implements an object and vehicle detection system using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The system is designed to identify and classify various objects and vehicles in real-time.


## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Md-Hasnain01/Object-and-Vehicle-detection.git


## yolocam.py

In yolocam.py taking data from ultralytics and through the model , we are able to detect the object.

## dcc.py

In dcc.py, We refine the data to only show the vehicals.

## ffdcc.py

This project implements a real-time vehicle detection and tracking system using the YOLOv8 model. The system is designed to identify specific vehicle classes in video footage and count the number of stopped vehicles within a defined Region of Interest (ROI).


### Features
Real-Time vehical detection: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model to detect vehicles such as cars, motorbikes, buses, and trucks.
Stopped Vehicle Detection: Counts vehicles that remain stationary within a defined ROI.

## sort.py
Simple Online and Realtime Tracking
This is a popular method for tracking multiple objects in video sequences.


## Requirments

-pyhton
-OpenCV
-ultralytics (YOLOv8)
-sort (for tracking)

## Installation
To install the required packages, you can use pip:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy cvzone ultralytics
``

Make sure to clone the SORT repository or install it if it's available via pip.
